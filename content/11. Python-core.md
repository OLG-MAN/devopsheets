### Operators
Arithmetic Operators: +  -  *  /  //  %  **
```
Add +
6 + 4 -> 10;
6. + 4. -> 10.0;
6 + 4. -> 10.0;
```
```
Subtract -
6 - 4 -> 2;
6. - 4. -> 2.0;
6 - 4. -> 2.0;
```
```
Multiply *
2 * 3 -> 6; 
2. * 3. -> 6.0; 
2 * 3. -> 6.0;
```
```
Divide / (output always float)
10 / 2 -> 5.0;
10. / 2. -> 5.0;
10 / 2. -> 5.0;

6 - -6 -> 12;
```

#### Operators Priority
Highest to --> lowest; operators from one group execute from left hand.
```
unary -->  **  -->  * / // %  -->  + -
```

#### Example
```
print(10 - 6 ** 2 / 9 * 10 + 1) -> -29;  
print((10 - 6) ** 2 / 8 * 10 + 1) -> 21;

#### Syntax sugar 
```
# standard expression
cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple + 2
cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple ** 2
cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple % 2
...

# short expression
cost_of_apple += 2
cost_of_apple **= 2
cost_of_apple %= 2
...
```

### Comments
```
amount_of_apples = 2   # Single comment, Amount in basket

# Single comment, top position, The cost of an apple in USD
cost_of_apple = 5
```

```
"""
This is a multi-line comment 
Amount in basket
This is a multi-line comment 
"""

amount_of_apples = 2
```

### Input
```
input("How are you feeling today? ")

How are you feeling today?
Fantastic!  # you type this
```

```
# input to var 

favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
blue # your input
print("Your favorite color is " + favorite_color)  # "Your favorite color is blue"
```

```
# switch input string ot int and make math operation'

age = input("How old are you? ")
How old are you? 
22 # your input
print(int(age) - 10)  # 12
```

### String Methods
```
# print function behavior

print(10 + 2)
12

print("Hello" + " " + "there!")
"Hello there!"

print("ha" * 4)
"hahahaha"

print("ha" * 0)
""

print("ha" * -1)
""

print(int("22"))
22

print(str(22))
"22"
```

```
# string method example

cost_of_apple = 2
amount_of_apples = input("How many apples do you want? ")

# How many apples do you want?
# 10

total_sum = cost_of_apple * int(amount_of_apples)
print("You have to pay: " + str(total_sum))

# You have to pay: 20

```

### Comparison Operators
```
==  # equal
!=  # not equal
>   # left more than right
>=  # left more or equal than right
<   # left less than right  
<=  # left less or equal than right
```

```
# examples
# ==
print("Hello!" == "Hello!")
True

print(4 == (2 * 2))
True

# !=
print("Hello!" != "Hello!")
False

print(4 != (2 * 2))
False

# >
print(4 > 2)
True 

print(2 > 2)
False

# >=
print(4 >= 4)
True

print(3 >= 4)
False

# <
print(4 < 4)
False

print(3 < 4)
True

# <=
print(2 <= 2)
True

print(2 <= 1)
False
```

### Conditional Statements
```
# basic concept example
if condition:
  print("The condition is true!")

# boolean conditions
if True:
print("The condition is true!")

if False:
print("The condition is true!")

# example
age = int(input("How old are you? "))

# How old are you? 
# 22

if age >= 18:
  print("You are an adult!")

# You are an adult!
```

```
# multiple conditions
if condition:
  print("The condition is true!")
elif second_condition:
  print("Only the second condition is true!")
else:
  print("Both conditions are false!”)

# example 1 with boolean
if False:
  print("The condition is true!")
elif True:
  print("Only the second condition is true!") # This condition will print
else:
  print("Both conditions are false!”)

# example 2 with boolean
if True:
  print("The condition is true!") # Just this condition will print, although we have True in 2 condition.
elif True:
  print("Only the second condition is true!")
else:
  print("Both conditions are false!”)
```

```
# Nested conditions
if age >= 18:
  if age == 18:
    print("You are exactly 18 years old!") # If age is equal 18 this will print
else:
  print("You older than 18 years old!")  # If age is greater than 18 this will print
```

### Loops
```
# concept, while condition is True make print 
while condition:
     print(x)
```

```
# example, guessing game with while loop
secret_number = 3
guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))

while guess != secret_number:
  guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
else:
  print("Congratulations, you got it!")

# Guess a number: 0
# Guess a number: 4
# Guess a number: 3
# Congratulations, you got it!
```

### For 
```
# concept
for … in …:

# concept basic 
for i in range(9):

# example 1
for i in range(3):
    print("i is: ", i)

# i is: 0
# i is: 1
# i is: 2

# example 2
for i in range(2,5):
    print("i is: ", i)

# i is: 2
# i is: 3
# i is: 4

# example with break
for i in range(4):
    if(i == 2):
        break
    print("i is: ", i)

# i is: 0
# i is: 1
# >>>

# example with continue
for i in range(4):
    if(i == 2):
        continue
    print("i is: ", i)

# i is: 0
# i is: 1
# i is: 3
# >>>
```

### Logical Operators

```
# basic operators
AND 
OR
NOT
```

```
# AND operator boolean statement
True  and True  ->  True
True  and False ->  False
False and True  ->  False
False and False ->  False

# OR operator boolean statement
True  and True  ->  True
True  and False ->  True
False and True  ->  True
False and False ->  False

# NOT operator boolean statement
True  -> False 
False -> True  
```

```
# Example AND OR

age1 = 24
age2 = 16

if( age1 >= 18 and age2 >= 18 ):
    print("You are both adults") # If 2 statements is True will print this one
elif( age1 >= 18 or age2 >= 18 ):
    print("One of you is an adult") # If 1 of 2 statements is True will print this one
else:
    print("You are both children”)  # If no one statements is True will print this one 
```

```
# Example 1  NOT
is_hungry = False 
if(not is_hungry):  # NOT FALSE -> True -> print phrase
    print("You are not hungry")   

# Example 2  NOT
is_hungry = True
if(not is_hungry):  # NOT TRUE -> skip 1st print -> print 'else' condition
  print("You are not hungry")  
else:
  print("You are hungry")
```

### Bitwise Operators
```
# Bitwise Operators
&  # Conjunction
|  # Disjunction 
~  # Negation
^  # Exclusive

& # If two bits 1 -> 1; (AND)
| # If one of 2 bits 1 -> 1; (OR)
^ # If one of 2 bits 1 -> 1; If 2 bits 1 -> 0; (XOR)
~ # Change bits;
```

```
# Example with &
15 & 22

print(bin(15))
0b1111
print(bin(22))
0b10110

15 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
22 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
->
6  0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0

15 & 22
# 6
```

```
# Example with |
15 | 22

print(bin(15))
0b1111
print(bin(22))
0b10110

15 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
22 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
->
31 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1

15 | 22
# 31
```

```
# Example with ^
15 ^ 22

print(bin(15))
0b1111
print(bin(22))
0b10110

15 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
22 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
->
25 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1

15 ^ 22
# 25
```

```
# Example with ~
print(~22)

print(bin(22))
0b10110

22  0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
->
-23 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1

print(~22)
# -23
```

#### Shortcuts operators
```
bit1 = bit1 & 22 -> bit1 &= 22

bit1 = bit1 | 22 -> bit1 |= 22

bit1 = bit1 ^ 22 -> bit1 ^= 22

```

#### Bit shifting
```
# Bit shifting operators 
>>  # Bit Shift Right
<<  # Bit Shift Left
```

```
# example 1 
print(22 >> 1)
22 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 
-> 
11 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
print(22 >> 1)
# 11

# example 2
print(22 << 1)
22 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 
<- 
44 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0
print(22 << 1)
# 44

```

```
# comparison with math operators, same result in expressions
print(22 // 2)  ->  print(22 >> 1)
print(22 // 4)  ->  print(22 >> 2)

print(22 * 2)   ->  print(22 << 1)
print(22 * 4)   ->  print(22 << 2)
```
