### HA k8s, ETCD in HA k8s
# It's need be a leader in master node for etcd work
# Leader election implementing by RAFT (ranodom timer for request-response)
# Who first send request and get responce became a leader
# Leader - is the first how write in queue to his own etcd 
# and next replicate with other masters

# Minimum number of nodes to k8s cluster functionality - quorum = N/2 + 1  (5/2 + 1)
# To best solutions for k8s it's 3 , 5 , and 7 master nodes for HA (odd numbers)
# e.g. 5 master nodes | 3 is quorum | 2 is falut tolerance
# If in cluster of 5 master more than 2 nodes fault - the cluster will down.
# Table of quorum
# 3 2 1
# 5 3 2
# 7 4 3
