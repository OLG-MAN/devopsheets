## Basics

### print func()
```
print ("Hello future Python programmer!");
"Hello future Python programmer!"

print ("Hello" + " future" + " Python" programmer!");
"Hello future Python programmer!"

print ("Hello, \nfuture Python programmer!");
"Hello,
future Python programmer!"

print ( "Hi" , "Hello" , sep="! " , end="❤️\n" )
print ( "So" , "enjoying python?" , sep= ", " , end="😄" )
Hi! Hello❤️
So, enjoying Python?😄
```

### Literals
Literal types:
1. Integers
• Octal numbers
• Hexadecimal numbers
2. Floating point numbers
3. Strings
4. Booleans

1. Integers
```
200  -90  1298901  1_000_000
```
```
Integers. Octal (8) numbers.
0o123 -> (8**2)* 1 (8**1)* 2 (8**0)* 3 -> 64*1 8*2 1*3 -> 64 16 3 -> 83
```
```
Integers. Hexadecimal (16) numbers.
0x123 -> (16**2)* 1 (16**1)* 2 (16**0)* 3 -> 256*1 16*2 1*3 -> 256 32 3 -> 291
```
2. Floating point numbers
```
45.50  -90.0  12.1  89.394
0.0000000000000000000001 -> 1e-22
```
3. Strings
```
"Hello!"  'Hello!'  'Hello "hi"'  'Hello \'hi\''
```
4. Boolean
```
True False  1 0
```

### Operators
Arithmetic Operators: +  -  *  /  //  %  **
```
Add +
6 + 4 -> 10;
6. + 4. -> 10.0;
6 + 4. -> 10.0;
```
```
Subtract -
6 - 4 -> 2;
6. - 4. -> 2.0;
6 - 4. -> 2.0;
```
```
Multiply *
2 * 3 -> 6; 
2. * 3. -> 6.0; 
2 * 3. -> 6.0;
```
```
Divide / (output always float)
10 / 2 -> 5.0;
10. / 2. -> 5.0;
10 / 2. -> 5.0;
```
```
6 / 4 -> 1.5;
6. / 4 -> 1.5;
6. / 4. -> 1.5;
```
```
Floor Divide //
6 // 4 -> 1.0;
6 // 4. -> 1.0;
6. // -4 -> -2.0;
```
```
Modulo %
4 % 2 -> 0;
5 % 2 -> 1;
```
```
Exponential **
2 ** 3 -> 8; 
1. ** 3. -> 8.0; 
2 ** 3. -> 8.0;
```
```
Unary operator -2
-6 - 6 -> -12;
6 - -6 -> 12;
```

#### Operators Priority
Highest to --> lowest; operators from one group execute from left hand.
```
unary -->  **  -->  * / // %  -->  + -
```

#### Example
```
print(10 - 6 ** 2 / 9 * 10 + 1) -> -29;  
print((10 - 6) ** 2 / 8 * 10 + 1) -> 21;
```

### Variables 
```
amount_of_apples = 2
cost_of_apple = 5

print(amount_of_apples * cost_of_apple)
```

#### Valid Variable Names
```
amount_of_apples
cost_of_apple
_total_cost
COST_OF_APPLE
```
#### Invalid Variable Names
```
am*unt_o%_app|es
c*st_o%_app|e
5apples_cost
del
elif
return 
etc ...
```
#### Reserved Keywords
```
False
None
True
and
as
assert
break
class
continue
def
del
elif
else
except
finally
for
from
global
if
import
in
is
lambda
nonlocal
not
or
pass
raise
return
try
while
with
yield
```

#### Syntax sugar 
```
# standard expression
cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple + 2
cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple ** 2
cost_of_apple = cost_of_apple % 2
...

# short expression
cost_of_apple += 2
cost_of_apple **= 2
cost_of_apple %= 2
...
```

### Comments
```
amount_of_apples = 2   # Single comment, Amount in basket

# Single comment, top position, The cost of an apple in USD
cost_of_apple = 5
```

```
"""
This is a multi-line comment 
Amount in basket
This is a multi-line comment 
"""

amount_of_apples = 2
```

### Input
```
input("How are you feeling today? ")

How are you feeling today?
Fantastic!  # you type this
```

```
# input to var 

favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
blue # your input
print("Your favorite color is " + favorite_color)  # "Your favorite color is blue"
```

```
# switch input string ot int and make math operation'

age = input("How old are you? ")
How old are you? 
22 # your input
print(int(age) - 10)  # 12
```

### String Methods
```
# print function behavior

print(10 + 2)
12

print("Hello" + " " + "there!")
"Hello there!"

print("ha" * 4)
"hahahaha"

print("ha" * 0)
""

print("ha" * -1)
""

print(int("22"))
22

print(str(22))
"22"
```

```
# string method example

cost_of_apple = 2
amount_of_apples = input("How many apples do you want? ")

# How many apples do you want?
# 10

total_sum = cost_of_apple * int(amount_of_apples)
print("You have to pay: " + str(total_sum))

# You have to pay: 20

```

### Comparison Operators
```
==  # equal
!=  # not equal
>   # left more than right
>=  # left more or equal than right
<   # left less than right  
<=  # left less or equal than right
```

```
# examples
# ==
print("Hello!" == "Hello!")
True

print(4 == (2 * 2))
True

# !=
print("Hello!" != "Hello!")
False

print(4 != (2 * 2))
False

# >
print(4 > 2)
True 

print(2 > 2)
False

# >=
print(4 >= 4)
True

print(3 >= 4)
False

# <
print(4 < 4)
False

print(3 < 4)
